Turned on to this by, once again, The Current - this Minneapolis band was hard to find
information about.  They were listed on several
year end local music critics best of lists.  Their sound is right up my alley.  Here's
hoping they have more success attracting attention.  If anyone hears of them playing
a gig please let me know.
