Another side project... This time it's Strokes drummer Fabrizo Moretti.  You can hear
the Strokes in this song.  I discovered these guys on Rhapsody when it recommended the
album to me based on my ratings of other songs.  I can't say enough good things about
Rhapsody.  Their recommendation engine has been one of the best I've seen (puts the
iTunes Genious to shame).  I hope they can continue to make it.  I'd be very sad to
lose that service.  This is the first album by Little Joy.  For some reason, the lead
singer reminds me a bit of one of the Brat Pack.  I found the entire album quite
enjoyable.  If you like this one you should definitely check it out.
