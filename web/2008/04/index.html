Now for another band that I should have been into much sooner.  In 2007, Dan loaned me
a DVD of Weezer videos.  I had always dismissed them as a shallow alt band that didn't
strike me as having too much of a distinguishing sound.  That video helped wake me up
to what interesting and smart music they write.  Especially intriguing is their lead singer
Rivers Cuomo who took a hiatus from the band to attend Harvard.  They make guitar-based power pop
with a great sense of humor (as if the cover wasn't a tip off).  This was one of the most enjoyable
albums from start to finish that came out this year.  This is their third self titled
album (others refered to as Blue and Green).  "How's this for art's and crafts" indeed.
