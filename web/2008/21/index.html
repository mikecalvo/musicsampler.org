<p>I'm tired, it's late, and I need to finish.  Thank you for your interest in this silly little
timewaster of mine.  I often complained to people this year that I wasn't happy about the music
in 2008, but looking back on this list of artists and songs, I'm really glad to be living in a time
of such creativity and originality.  I hope you can find new music that inspires you or simply makes
you happy.<br>

The Kooks are from Brighton England and take their name from a song on the Bowie classic album
Hunky Dory.  Konk is their second album and it is a jem of great pop from start to finish.  Amy
and I had the great pleasure of seeing them at the Fine Line this year.  We really are lucky to
have such great music at intimate venues in Minneapolis.<br>

You have my sincerest best wishes for a happy and healthy holidays and new year.<br>
Mike
