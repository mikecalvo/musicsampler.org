<p>This year I was given a double treat of new albums by both Stereolab
and Monade (side project of lead singer Laetitia Sadier).  Chemical Chords
is a pretty straight forward pop album by this typically art school band.
Most of the songs are under three and a half minutes and many recall sounds
of 60's Motown.  Sadly, I was unable to attend a Stereolab/Monade double
bill at the Main Room in October.  Hopefully, the fact that these guys seem
to have no shortage of material will mean more return trips to the Twin
Cities will be in our future.  I'm so grateful for their music.
