At the moment of writing this, this is my favorite song from this collection.  I'm so
grateful to Amy for suggesting it to me.  As I was putting the finishing touches on the
collection I was doing a sanity check with her to make sure none of the songs were
over the top offensive or completely unsustainable.  Some of you may wonder why she didn't
stop me then.  Seemingly out of the blue, she said what about "Strawberry Weed".  This
triggered something in my brain that I had heard something remotely about a song of that
title.  I sprinted to my laptop, looked it up on Rhapsody, heard it, loved it - end of story.
like the Hives on last year's list - these guys are from Sweden.  Here's hoping they show
up in town in January like the Hives did this year.
