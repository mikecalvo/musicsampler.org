<p>The members of The Submarines survived a failed relationship to reunite as
both a band an a married couple.  This instantly catchy tune comes from the
second album by the LA-based band.  John Dragonetti (great name) and Blake
Hazard take turns on vocals throughout the album.  The inclusion of one of their songs on the
"Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist" soundrack adds to their buzz factor.
