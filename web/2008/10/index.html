"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick, the one that makes me scream she said".
The Cure's 1987 alternative hit classic opens with this line.  The Watson Twins' cover
of the song was another musical highlight for me this year.  Amy and I first heard it on
the radio in northern Minnesota at the Carlson's family cabin Thanksgiving weekend.
It was one of those wonderful musical moments where you're delighted to hear one of your favorite
songs done in a totally different way in a completely unexpected place (no offence, but northern Minnesota
radio is a place almost completely devoid of any overlap with my musical taste).  This fine version
stays true to the original in melody and lyric and in some ways provides a way to more clearly focus
on the supurb elements of this song.  It's always great to be at the right place at the right time.
Thanks to the Carlson's for providing that opportunity.
