How do you know you've gotten old?  One of the biggest bands of your life time gets
distilled down to a simple question - "Oasis - aren't they from the 90's?".  This was
the response from a young coworker of mine when asked if she would like to attend
the Oasis show while visiting our office.  Indeed - the 90's (and Manchester)-based
Oasis is still releasing new music and touring.  Their release this year contained
a number of catchy tunes and had plenty of Beatles references to go around.  Noel
Gallagher continues to prove his great ability to craft listenable songs that can
fill a stadium.  This geezer is glad to be able to see these legends live even
if it is at Target Center.
