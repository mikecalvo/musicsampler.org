It was my delight to see The Breeders twice live this year.  The first time at the
Main Room at 1st Avenue.  Thanks to Stacey who elbowed our group's way up stage-side
for what was a real thrill for me to watch the Deal sisters perform live up close and
personal.  Unfortunately Stacey was not with me in Seattle when I saw them next.  I had
to settle for the back of the hall.  It was still a great night of music.  Kelly, originally
from Pixies fame, has a great skill for writing and performing twanging surf rock.  This cover
of a Roberto Cantoral song is a classic example of how they sound their best in this genre.  Those
of you who are Spanish speaking might cringe at her imperfect pronunciation, but I view that
as all part of the charm of their music.
