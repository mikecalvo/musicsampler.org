This summer Lorna provided me with a mix of songs on her heavy play list at the time.
It was an incredible mix of songs, some new and some familiar to me, but all very good.
This was one of the songs from that mix.  In fact, I had a hard time not just stealing her
mix for this sampler.  Okkervil River was a new band to me in 2008, however this is their
six release.  They are from Austin, TX.  Here's hoping we can catch them some time while
we're down there visiting Jill and Cindy
