DJ, vegan, activist, Christian - many words describe this multifacited, super
talented DJ.  One thing's for sure - he really defies stereotypes.  I've been
a fan of his since hearing Play back in 1999.  I don't universally love everything
he's done, but I do respect him immensely.  Amy put it best - "you have to put a Moby
song on there - he's such a <span lang="en-us"></span>great guy".  I do like his release Last Night from this
year more than some of his more recent albums.  It's great stuff to have on at a party.
