John Hughes, Molly Ringwald, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club, Psychedelic Furs, and John Cryer
are all images the new M83 album resurrects.  It's obvious from the album cover that M83
founder Anthony Golzalez and I have similar recollections of our youth.  Many of the songs
on this album could have come right out of a 1985 John Hughes soundtrack.  M83 was
actually in town on a couple of occasions this year playing ultra cool venues like the
Triple Rock Social club.  Their next performance is at Northrop in January.  Sounds like
they are gaining momentum.  They deserve it in my opinion.
