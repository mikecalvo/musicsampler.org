It's funny - with the Internet, you can listen to basically any radio station from any city
in the world.  And yet, I still cling to my home town Current as though it were the best
radio station option in the world.  Call it local pride or call it no Internet in my car yet, I
still find the DJ's at the Current to be some of the most insightful and interesting music
sources around.  Each year I will typically call my favorite DJ at the time to ask for a
suggestion for this list.  This year it was Mac Wilson.  I have felt a bond with Mac ever
since he posted a question on the Current web site asking people to rank their top 5 New Order
albums.  Mac, in no uncertain terms, told me that my sampler had to include this specific
song.  I had not heard the song before, but when I did I found that I did not love it, but
liked it enough.  Not surprisingly, the more I listened to it, the more I like it.  Great,
now I have another band to learn about.

    I try to compile this list as I go throughout the year.  Invariably, what happens every year is that
    the 12 to 15 songs I have in June are no longer part of the list in December.  I may have grown sick
    of them or maybe felt the song really wasn't as strong as I originally thought.  I doubt I'm any more
    thoughtful about selections later in the year, it's just that I've had less time to grow sick of them.
    This song has been on my list since first hearing it and has stayed there.  Cut Copy are from
    Australia and their AMG (All Music Guide) entry compares them with LCD Sounsystem, Daft Punk, and Air.
    How could I not like them.
