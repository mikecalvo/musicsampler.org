After the very down Sea Change in 2003, it was time for the Loser to bring back the fun.  His performance on Saturday Night Live was a preview of his concert at Roy Wilkins Auditorium that I had the good fortune of attending.  In this typical nerd-inspired self mockery, the stage show included a non-instrument playing band member dressed in Beck-chic short-sleeve button down shirt with a black tie and wrist bands.  His only role was to bang on a piece of garbage with a drum stick and dance around inciting the crowd.  He had me grinning from ear-to-ear.   The other standout track on Guero is \\''Girl\\'' which was a close second for inclusion in this sampler.  Beck has a favorite of Amy and mine going back to my earliest days in Minnesota in the winter of 94.  He and I are almost exactly the same age and in some strange way I feel like I really identify with him.', 1, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(2, 'A Few Steps More', 'Monade', 'A Few Steps More', '2005 was an unusual year in that there was no new LP from Stereolab.  The prolific group usually gifts me with one album per year.  As an excellent consolation prize we did get a new album by Monade, the side project of the lab\\''s lead singer Laetitia Sadier.  Although quite different, the similarities can be heard and certainly Laetitia\\''s vocals provide a very similar and comforting sound.  This was another wonderful live show that I got to attend this year.  Amy, Paul and Jennifer H, and I saw then in the 7th Street entry after the smoking ban went into effect.  We stood against the stage as I once again found myself grinning from ear-to-ear feeling completely inspired by the moment.  It was only my second show at "the Entry" but it solidified my admiration of it as an intimate and legendary venue in Minneapolis.  Plus, I didn\\''t have to leave my clothes outside for the week after the show!', 2, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(3, 'Here Comes The Summer', 'The Fiery Furnaces', 'EP', 'In the first weeks of 2005 I was blissfully enjoying my love affair with the online music service Rhapsody.  At the time, EP, the newest release by Fiery Furnaces (a brother and sister group from Brooklyn) was the featured album of the day.  I was really drawn to Eleanor Friedberger\\''s conventional voice and their slightly dissonant sound that somehow resulted in very listenable pop.  I admire these guys because they are young, prolific, unconventional and very original.  I saw them live at the Fine Line and was a bit disappointed.  They didn\\''t play much if anything from EP, but it was still obvious that they are two very talented artists.  I may not like everything they put out, I\\''m glad I learned about them this year.', 3, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(4, 'Bloc Party', 'Banquet', 'Silent Alarm', 'Bloc Party sounds like an early eighties post-punk band.  It\\''s amazing that it\\''s been long enough since post-punk for a revival.  Bloc party does it well and makes for good party music.  I\\''m instantly brought back to "Boys Don\\''t Cry" by The Cure.  To me, they are what Franz Ferdinand was last year.  Not original?  Perhaps.  Fun?  Definitely.', 4, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(5, 'Mrs. Bartolozi', 'Kate Bush', 'Aerial', '1994 was the last time Kate Bush released an album.  She\\''s been one of my favorite artists since first discovering her.  I love her voice and her talent for theatrics and orchestration that is uncommon in popular music.  Aerial is a double album that didn\\''t depart from Kate\\''s typical style and I for one was happy about that.  The punch line here is that if you like Ms. Bush you will probably like this album.  Welcome back Babushka.', 5, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(6, 'Disco Infiltrator', 'LCD Soundsystem', 'LCD Soundsystem', 'The new MPR radio station the Current had to be the local music event of the year for me.  I am profoundly happy that we live in a town that has a station like the Current.  Not only because of the music they play, but also because it says that we live somewhere that there are enough people that appreciate the same music I do to have a station like the Current.  LCD Soundsystem was one of the first bands introduced to me by the Current.  LCD Soundsystem is James Murphy.  He is a DJ with a not-so subtle respect for other artists in the electronic and DJ genres.  The first single from the album is a track entitled "Daft Punk is Playing at My House" which had me intrigued immediately.  It was just the beginning of the joy of new music brought courtesy of the Current.', 6, 2005);

They had a catchy, repetitive sound that I am typically a sucker for.  Their new album features songs with titles that correspond to years.  I haven\\''t spent the time to figure out the correlation between the year and the song.  Our featured song has a surprise guest vocalist.  Can you guess who it is?  Those of you who received my collection last year get a clue: he\\''s a repeat.', 7, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(8, 'Dare', 'Gorillaz', 'Demon Days', 'This comes from what is probably the most commercially popular album on my list.  Heck, I was even bonding with a hip high school girl at a recent holiday part about Gorllaz. "Dare" was not the big hit from the album, which was a song you may have heard, called "Feel Good Inc." which is a great pop single in its own right.  Gorillaz is an band that is made up of 4 animated characters.  The real person behind the band is former Blur front man Damon Albam.  I enjoy  Gorillaz, quite a bit but I like Blur even more.  For those of you not familiar with them if you like Gorillaz, you should probably heck out Blur as well.  This is a remixed version of Dare which I found extra fun.', 8, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(9, 'Beautiful', 'Goldfrapp', 'Number 1', 'I personally discovered Goldfrapp watching MTV2 about 4 years ago.  Apparently, someone at MTV still cared about music at that point (I\\''m sad to report MTV2 has since become an endless loop of Real World and Cribs reruns).  Alison Goldfrapp has a hauntingly beautiful voice and typically places it over really cool and sometimes retro-sounding electronica.  Although, she only released a 4 song EP in 2005, she, in my mind, is one of the most promising young artists in electronic music.  I\\''m dazzled by her voice (if it\\''s not already apparent, I\\''m a sucker for female - especially French, vocalists).', 9, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(10, 'Bells', 'Electrelane', 'Axes', 'What a surprise, Mike, more females!  Electreleane was a great discovery last year and are the only repeat artist on this year\\''s list.  I was disappointed to miss their show at First Avenue this year (see I really don\\''t make it to EVERY show in town).  I love their bass-heavy minimalist sound.  I did not enjoy their 2005 release, Axes, as much as 2004\\''s The Power Out, but it\\''s still an exciting new band that I\\''m keeping my eye on.', 10, 2005);

The latest evidence of this is that I periodically call in to DJ\\''s at the Current.  What do I call them for?  It varies.  Sometimes I want to let them know someone out there really likes what they are playing.  Sometimes I have a request.  Sometimes, I\\''m asking for advice on new music.  My favorite DJ at the Current is Mark Wheat who does the 7-12PM shift weekdays.  As part of compiling this CD I decided to cheat a little and call Mark to ask him what he would include on such a CD.  This entry and the Clap Your Hands Say Yeah song were recommendations of his.  This song, in particular, he said was the most requested song he had this year.  What do you think?', 11, 2005);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(12, 'Day Without You', 'Royksopp', 'The Understanding', 'Yet another Current find, Royksopp is the critical darling of the downtempo crowd.  They are the first band from Scandinavia  I\\''ve been into since the Cardigans.  Shortly after hearing about them on the Current, I read a review of their music written by Nick Hornby ("High Fidelity" and "About a Boy") that also led me to listen to them more.  For Norwegians, this electronica has a lot of soul to me.', 12, 2005);

Is it just me, or does this sound like a circa 1982 Talking Heads song?  Lyrics are fun and this is certainly not a boring or unoriginal group.

INSERT INTO song VALUES(15, 'Krafty', 'New Order', 'Waiting for the Siren’s Call', 'The fact that I had the self control to not only include just one song from the new New Order album but also make it the last song in the collection is out of character for me.  The highlight of the year for me musically was this album.  I have enough perspective to know that I have zero objectivity when it comes to New Order.  They have been one of my favorite bands for the past 20 years.  This year I went on a wild mid-week trip to see them play live in Chicago on a Tuesday night with Paul D and Mike L.  Barney, Hooky and the boys did not disappoint.  I have practically worn through one copy of this CD this year.  I\\''m happy to have music that I enjoy so much.  I wish the same pleasure for you.', 15, 2005);

Sometimes, the only remedy is some good old fashioned house music to help get you over the hump and put an instant smile on your face.  This selection comes from fellow geek Serge who undoubtedly uses it for a different purpose - motivation during a workout or run.  Either way, this was a great new find of 2006.  I think you\\''ll find the whole album perfect for dancing, driving fast, parties, workouts, and of course geeking out.', 1, 2006);

Brad H. responded with a list that contained Hard-Fi and I\\''m sure glad he did.  Young Bradley discovered a gem here.  This is a very listenable Brit Pop album from start to finish with songs that recall The Clash, Pulp and The Specials.  It was a tough task to choose one from this album.', 2, 2006);

Sorry guys, sometimes you sacrifice originality for quality.  I must say it wasn\\''t a great year for the Groop.  They put out this collection of songs that were actually released in 2005 as a trio of 12" maxi singles on vinyl only. ON VINYL ONLY!  I mean I appreciate the esoteric artist probably more than most, but that\\''s too much even for me.  The collection wasn\\''t my favorite of theirs, but still had some standouts like this one.

I figured I\\''d give it a listen and I\\''m glad I did.  She has a surprisingly hard rocking edge that makes her much more interesting to me than most adult contemporary artists.  She\\''s also one of several artists on the list hailing from Scotland - a testament to the great music coming out of England\\''s friendly neighbor (sorry Paul D and Lars).', 4, 2006);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(20, 'You Made It', 'DJ Shadow', 'The Outsider', 'This schizophrenic release by the sampling master is a far cry from his classic "Endtroducing" album of 1996, but it still contains a couple of great songs like this one.  As you can tell, this really doesn\\''t sound like DJ music at all, which has always been one of Shadow\\''s strengths: defying convention and merging sounds that weren’t designed to be merged.  Unless you’re a fan of hip hop music, I’d stay clear of this album, but enjoy this tune and definitely checkout Endtroducing if you don\\''t have it already.', 5, 2006);

Actually, these old favorites of mine put out one of their best albums in years in 2006.  They\\''ve departed a bit from their typical light folk pop on The Life Pursuit as this vampy number indicates.  Like many of the choices on this list, they employ musical elements of the 60\\''s and 70\\''s rock and pop in a modern revision of classic sounds.  To me this is their best full album since The Boy with the Arab Strap.  Did I mention that they\\''re Scottish?', 6, 2006);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(22, 'On The Radio', 'Regina Spektor', 'Begin To Hope', 'I first heard this song on the Current and immediately liked it.  I found the lyrics interesting and her voice seemed Bjork-ish to me.  She describes hearing the song "November Rain" by Guns n\\'' Roses on the radio and how the DJ fell asleep so she heard it twice.  Despite liking the song she offers up some fairly valid criticisms about the guitar solo.  I don\\''t know why I find this amusing.', 7, 2006);
INSERT INTO song VALUES(23, 'Crazy', 'Gnarls Barkley', 'St. Elsewhere', 'Gnarls Barkley is more than just a funny name.  It\\''s the duo of record producer Danger Mouse and wrapper Cee Lo combining to create some great experimental hip hop.  "Crazy" got mainstream radio airplay (or so I hear) and their cover of the Violent Femmes "Gone Baby Gone" is also great.  It\\''s no wonder that its sound and style is similar in nature to Gorillaz.  Danger Mouse was their producer.', 8, 2006);

It was not released in the US until February.  It\\''s as solid as everything they\\''ve done to date. It\\''s great retro-sounding synth pop fronted by one of the greatest voices in pop music.  I could listen to Goldfrapp for hours.  During the Superbowl this year I even saw a Pepsi commercial using "Ooh La La" from this album.

Glasgow\\''s Camera Obscura has been around for several years, but has flown under my radar until hearing it played by Mark Wheat in October on The Current.  I could not get this music out of my head.  Tracyanne Campbell\\''s voice is sweet and the lyrics are funny and smart.  It has a classic Belle &amp; Sebastian sound, and also revives some 60\\''s and 70\\''s girl band personas.  This was my favorite album of the year.', 10, 2006);

Another recommendation by Rhapsody based on my listening patterns, this is a recording session that Norweigan Baroque Pop (as I have learned one my favorite genres of music) artist Sondre Lerche made with the Faces Down Quartet.

It typically includes William Shatner, but alas we were not blessed with any new Shatner music in 2006 (to my knowledge).  As a great consolation prize I give you a remake of the Smith\\''s classic from a CD of  Bassanova covers of 80\\''s new wave hits.  This is great stuff for 80\\''s music fans and allows us to get reacquainted with some classic Morrissey lyrics.  Sorry Moz, your new album this year just doesn\\''t compare to your old classics.

He mentioned that they were getting significant airplay in Southern California where he was living at the time.  I assumed that because of the name of the band and the fact they were favorites in LA that they were some sort of Los Lobos protege.  Bad assumption.  They are actually a three piece band from Hoboken New Jersey plays eclectic guitar and organ-oriented indie rock that seems similar to Stereolab.  This adventurous album is quite varied in sound and I found it a lot of fun.  This particular song has a sort of Vince Guaraldi feel to it.', 13, 2006);

Their new album got heavy rotation on The Current.  It seemed like the rare case of music that was played consistently by all the DJs.  Well, when I finally got around to hearing the whole album, they were as good as I\\''d been told.  Again the 70\\''s musical styles abound on this one.

I didn\\''t know until writing this that Primal Scream is from Scotland and not Manchester where I had assumed they were from.  My instinct is to think every influential post-Beatles band is from Manchester.  Primal Scream was really relevant 15 years ago with Screamadelica and then they just sort of stopped.  That\\''s what made this album such a surprise.  It\\''s a fun Rolling Stones-style bluesy, down and dirty rock and roll.

The Hold Steady is a Brooklyn band who originated from the Twin Cities and likes to write lyrics about our home town.

Since then, I\\''ve followed Saint Etienne off and on and found them to always produce quality music in what has come to be known as "Dream Pop".  Lead singer Sarah Cracknell is right up my alley vocally.  This year\\''s CD is a concept album about the characters living in an apartment building in London.

See, who says advertising on the web doesn\\''t work.  Anyways, The Oohlas sound like the Pixies-Throwing Muses-Belly-Breeders branch of alternative music.
