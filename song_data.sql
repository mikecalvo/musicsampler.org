After the very down Sea Change in 2003, it was time for the Loser to bring back the fun.  His performance on Saturday Night Live was a preview of his concert at Roy Wilkins Auditorium that I had the good fortune of attending.  In this typical nerd-inspired self mockery, the stage show included a non-instrument playing band member dressed in Beck-chic short-sleeve button down shirt with a black tie and wrist bands.  His only role was to bang on a piece of garbage with a drum stick and dance around inciting the crowd.  He had me grinning from ear-to-ear.   The other standout track on Guero is ''Girl'' which was a close second for inclusion in this sampler.  Beck has a favorite of Amy and mine going back to my earliest days in Minnesota in the winter of 94.  He and I are almost exactly the same age and in some strange way I feel like I really identify with him.', 1, 2005);

The prolific group usually gifts me with one album per year.  As an excellent consolation prize we did get a new album by Monade, the side project of the lab''s lead singer Laetitia Sadier.  Although quite different, the similarities can be heard and certainly Laetitia''s vocals provide a very similar and comforting sound.  This was another wonderful live show that I got to attend this year.  Amy, Paul and Jennifer H, and I saw then in the 7th Street entry after the smoking ban went into effect.  We stood against the stage as I once again found myself grinning from ear-to-ear feeling completely inspired by the moment.  It was only my second show at "the Entry" but it solidified my admiration of it as an intimate and legendary venue in Minneapolis.  Plus, I didn''t have to leave my clothes outside for the week after the show!', 2, 2005);

At the time, EP, the newest release by Fiery Furnaces (a brother and sister group from Brooklyn) was the featured album of the day.  I was really drawn to Eleanor Friedberger''s conventional voice and their slightly dissonant sound that somehow resulted in very listenable pop.  I admire these guys because they are young, prolific, unconventional and very original.  I saw them live at the Fine Line and was a bit disappointed.  They didn''t play much if anything from EP, but it was still obvious that they are two very talented artists.  I may not like everything they put out, I''m glad I learned about them this year.', 3, 2005);

It''s amazing that it''s been long enough since post-punk for a revival.  Bloc party does it well and makes for good party music.  I''m instantly brought back to "Boys Don''t Cry" by The Cure.  To me, they are what Franz Ferdinand was last year.  Not original?  Perhaps.  Fun?  Definitely.', 4, 2005);

She''s been one of my favorite artists since first discovering her.  I love her voice and her talent for theatrics and orchestration that is uncommon in popular music.  Aerial is a double album that didn''t depart from Kate''s typical style and I for one was happy about that.  The punch line here is that if you like Ms. Bush you will probably like this album.  Welcome back Babushka.', 5, 2005);

I am profoundly happy that we live in a town that has a station like the Current.  Not only because of the music they play, but also because it says that we live somewhere that there are enough people that appreciate the same music I do to have a station like the Current.  LCD Soundsystem was one of the first bands introduced to me by the Current.  LCD Soundsystem is James Murphy.  He is a DJ with a not-so subtle respect for other artists in the electronic and DJ genres.  The first single from the album is a track entitled "Daft Punk is Playing at My House" which had me intrigued immediately.  It was just the beginning of the joy of new music brought courtesy of the Current.', 6, 2005);

I haven''t spent the time to figure out the correlation between the year and the song.  Our featured song has a surprise guest vocalist.  Can you guess who it is?  Those of you who received my collection last year get a clue: he''s a repeat.', 7, 2005);

Heck, I was even bonding with a hip high school girl at a recent holiday part about Gorllaz. "Dare" was not the big hit from the album, which was a song you may have heard, called "Feel Good Inc." which is a great pop single in its own right.  Gorillaz is an band that is made up of 4 animated characters.  The real person behind the band is former Blur front man Damon Albam.  I enjoy  Gorillaz, quite a bit but I like Blur even more.  For those of you not familiar with them if you like Gorillaz, you should probably heck out Blur as well.  This is a remixed version of Dare which I found extra fun.', 8, 2005);

Apparently, someone at MTV still cared about music at that point (I''m sad to report MTV2 has since become an endless loop of Real World and Cribs reruns).  Alison Goldfrapp has a hauntingly beautiful voice and typically places it over really cool and sometimes retro-sounding electronica.  Although, she only released a 4 song EP in 2005, she, in my mind, is one of the most promising young artists in electronic music.  I''m dazzled by her voice (if it''s not already apparent, I''m a sucker for female - especially French, vocalists).', 9, 2005);

Electreleane was a great discovery last year and are the only repeat artist on this year''s list.  I was disappointed to miss their show at First Avenue this year (see I really don''t make it to EVERY show in town).  I love their bass-heavy minimalist sound.  I did not enjoy their 2005 release, Axes, as much as 2004''s The Power Out, but it''s still an exciting new band that I''m keeping my eye on.', 10, 2005);

Hey - at least I admit it.  The latest evidence of this is that I periodically call in to DJ''s at the Current.  What do I call them for?  It varies.  Sometimes I want to let them know someone out there really likes what they are playing.  Sometimes I have a request.  Sometimes, I''m asking for advice on new music.  My favorite DJ at the Current is Mark Wheat who does the 7-12PM shift weekdays.  As part of compiling this CD I decided to cheat a little and call Mark to ask him what he would include on such a CD.  This entry and the Clap Your Hands Say Yeah song were recommendations of his.  This song, in particular, he said was the most requested song he had this year.  What do you think?', 11, 2005);

They are the first band from Scandinavia  I''ve been into since the Cardigans.  Shortly after hearing about them on the Current, I read a review of their music written by Nick Hornby ("High Fidelity" and "About a Boy") that also led me to listen to them more.  For Norwegians, this electronica has a lot of soul to me.', 12, 2005);

The highlight of the year for me musically was this album.  I have enough perspective to know that I have zero objectivity when it comes to New Order.  They have been one of my favorite bands for the past 20 years.  This year I went on a wild mid-week trip to see them play live in Chicago on a Tuesday night with Paul D and Mike L.  Barney, Hooky and the boys did not disappoint.  I have practically worn through one copy of this CD this year.  I''m happy to have music that I enjoy so much.

Sometimes, the only remedy is some good old fashioned house music to help get you over the hump and put an instant smile on your face.  This selection comes from fellow geek Serge who undoubtedly uses it for a different purpose - motivation during a workout or run.  Either way, this was a great new find of 2006.  I think you''ll find the whole album perfect for dancing, driving fast, parties, workouts, and of course geeking out.', 1, 2006);

Brad H. responded with a list that contained Hard-Fi and I''m sure glad he did.  Young Bradley discovered a gem here.

Sorry guys, sometimes you sacrifice originality for quality.  I must say it wasn''t a great year for the Groop.  They put out this collection of songs that were actually released in 2005 as a trio of 12" maxi singles on vinyl only. ON VINYL ONLY!  I mean I appreciate the esoteric artist probably more than most, but that''s too much even for me.  The collection wasn''t my favorite of theirs, but still had some standouts like this one.

I figured I''d give it a listen and I''m glad I did.  She has a surprisingly hard rocking edge that makes her much more interesting to me than most adult contemporary artists.

As you can tell, this really doesn''t sound like DJ music at all, which has always been one of Shadow''s strengths: defying convention and merging sounds that weren''t designed to be merged.  Unless you''re a fan of hip hop music, I''d stay clear of this album, but enjoy this tune and definitely checkout Endtroducing if you don''t have it already.', 5, 2006);

Actually, these old favorites of mine put out one of their best albums in years in 2006.  They''ve departed a bit from their typical light folk pop on The Life Pursuit as this vampy number indicates.  Like many of the choices on this list, they employ musical elements of the 60''s and 70''s rock and pop in a modern revision of classic sounds.

I found the lyrics interesting and her voice seemed Bjork-ish to me.  She describes hearing the song "November Rain" by Guns n'' Roses on the radio and how the DJ fell asleep so she heard it twice.

It''s the duo of record producer Danger Mouse and wrapper Cee Lo combining to create some great experimental hip hop.  "Crazy" got mainstream radio airplay (or so I hear) and their cover of the Violent Femmes "Gone Baby Gone" is also great.  It''s no wonder that its sound and style is similar in nature to Gorillaz.  Danger Mouse was their producer.', 8, 2006);

Released in 2005 in the UK, Supernature is Goldfrapp''s third album release.  It was not released in the US until February.  It''s as solid as everything they''ve done to date. It''s great retro-sounding synth pop fronted by one of the greatest voices in pop music.  I could listen to Goldfrapp for hours.

Glasgow''s Camera Obscura has been around for several years, but has flown under my radar until hearing it played by Mark Wheat in October on The Current.  I could not get this music out of my head.  Tracyanne Campbell''s voice is sweet and the lyrics are funny and smart.  It has a classic Belle & Sebastian sound, and also revives some 60''s and 70''s girl band personas.

As a great consolation prize I give you a remake of the Smith''s classic from a CD of  Bassanova covers of 80''s new wave hits.  This is great stuff for 80''s music fans and allows us to get reacquainted with some classic Morrissey lyrics.  Sorry Moz, your new album this year just doesn''t compare to your old classics.

I assumed that because of the name of the band and the fact they were favorites in LA that they were some sort of Los Lobos protege.  Bad assumption.  They are actually a three piece band from Hoboken New Jersey plays eclectic guitar and organ-oriented indie rock that seems similar to Stereolab.

His new album - this song in particular - got significant airplay on The Current, and I found myself drawn to it.

You can just envision singer Alison VV Mosshart coughing like she does at the start of the song, unimpressed as you approach her in a seedy dive bar.

This song really sticks out for the percussive qualities as the title suggests.  A little bit like a more radio-friendly version of 15 Step by Radiohead this song was also a big hit on the Current this year.  ""It''s Frightening"" is the Brooklyn band''s second album.  They''ve toured supporting Kaiser Chiefs and Spoon.');

For a variety of reasons (none good), I couldn''t make it happen.  Here''s the make up.  This is a track from their forthcoming album to be released in 2010 that was available for free download from the band''s website.  It''s a great Christmas time song that''s light, catchy and fun.  Definitely love the xylophone action.');

There are some other interesting options on this album including Lily Allen covering the Clash ""Straight To Hell"".  Can you hear the seagull sample in this track? </p>');

We wait for our favorite band to finally release that new album after year of waiting and reading blogs and fan sites.  Well, sort of like that.  Sometimes we wait and your favorite band decides they can''t stand each other anymore.  So they have an awkward, clumsy, sad public breakup over myspace and said fan sites and some of the remaining members release a new album under a new band name with some additional people added to the mix.  Sigh… sorry.  New Order split (boo!).  Lead singer Bernard Sumner forms a new band Bad Lieutenant (yay!).  Invites drummer Stephen Morris to play on only a few songs (huh?) and we get the album ""Never Cry Another Tear"" (yeah right) in 2009.  I wouldn''t call it great and I wouldn''t call it a disappointment.  This track sounds the most ""New-Ordery"" to me.  Despite that the music has ended, let''s hope that the beat just goes on.&nbsp;</p>');
